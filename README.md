## Credits
 Credits & Inspiration

ansi-meow was born thanks to the inspiration of incredible terminal customization projects. 
A big shout-out to:

🔹 **[Pokémon-Colorscripts](https://gitlab.com/phoneybadger/pokemon-colorscripts)** – An amazing project that brought the magic of Pokémon to the terminal with beautifully designed colorscripts. It inspired me to explore creativity in the visual presentation of scripts. 

🔹 **[Meow](https://github.com/PixelSergey/meow)** – A feline project that influenced my approach to effects, ASCII art, and an enthusiast-friendly aesthetic for the terminal. 

Without these projects, ansi-meow wouldn't exist in its current form. Thanks for the inspiration! 🎨🐱✨🚀
