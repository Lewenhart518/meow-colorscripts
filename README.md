## Themes  
This project supports several themes and color schemes that enhance your terminal‚Äôs aesthetics:

- **Nord Theme**: A clean, elegant arctic color scheme developed by [Sven Greb](https://www.nordtheme.com).  
- **Catppuccin**: A community-driven pastel theme offering variants such as Latte, Frapp√©, Macchiato, and Mocha.  
- **Everforest**: A soft, low-contrast theme optimized to reduce eye strain.  

Thanks to the creators and communities behind these themes for their amazing work.

## Installation  
To install `meow-colorscripts`, run the following commands in your terminal:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lewenhart518/meow-colorscripts.git
``` 
```bash
cd meow-colorscripts
``` 
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
``` 
```bash
clear && ./install.sh
```  

The installation script will automatically:  
- Set up the required configuration folder.  
- Move the configuration from `~/meow-colorscripts/.config/meow-colorscripts/` to `~/.config/meow-colorscripts/`.  
- Copy necessary files (like `show-meows.sh`).  
- Add the alias `ansi-meow` to your shell configuration.  
- Ask if you want to open the interactive setup immediately.

## Configuration  
Customize your installation using:  

```bash
meow-colorscripts-setup
```  

This command allows you to interactively choose your configuration options:  

- **Select your style** (e.g., *normal*, *nocolor*, a theme such as *nord*, *catpuccin*, *everforest*, or ASCII-based styles: *ascii* and *ascii-color*).  
- **Choose the cat size** (small, normal, large) or the ASCII type (keyboard symbols or blocks, which are treated as ‚Äúsize‚Äù) for ASCII styles.  
- **Activate additional commands**:  
  - `meows-names` displays the list of available cat designs.  
  - `show-meow [name]` displays the ANSI art for the specified cat design.  
- **Enable auto-run**: Decide if you want `ansi-meow` to execute automatically when opening a terminal.

During setup, responses are handled interactively:  
- In Spanish, answer with **s** (s√≠) or **n** (no).  
- In English, answer with **y** (yes) or **n** (no).
