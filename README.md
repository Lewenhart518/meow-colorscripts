## ✨ Credits & Inspiration

ansi-meow was born thanks to the inspiration of incredible terminal customization projects. 
A huge shout-out to:

🔹 **[Pokémon-Colorscripts](https://github.com/Pokemon-Colorscripts/Pokemon-Colorscripts)** – An amazing project that brought the magic of Pokémon to the terminal with beautifully designed colorscripts. It inspired me to explore creativity in the visual presentation of scripts.

🔹 **[Meow](https://github.com/NicholasDun/meow)** – A feline project that influenced my approach to effects, ASCII art, and an enthusiast-friendly aesthetic for the terminal.

Without these projects, ansi-meow would not exist in its current form. Thanks for the inspiration! 🎨🐱✨🚀
